## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to develop an AI-powered platform with a built-in chatbot and voice interface to assist farmers, especially small and marginal ones. Many farmers struggle because they are unaware of which crops are best suited for their soil type and the right time for cultivation. This application will guide them by providing accurate information on suitable crops for specific soils and the appropriate time for sowing. It will also recommend the correct type and quantity of fertilizers to ensure healthy crop growth without causing damage, thereby increasing yield while protecting the environment. In addition, farmers can upload images of their crops to the AI system to check for diseases or pest attacks, allowing them to take timely preventive measures. Overall, this solution will empower farmers with knowledge to cultivate effectively, improve productivity, and maintain their crops in better condition.

## Technical Approach

1) Front-end :
Programming Language: Kotlin , Swift.
Framework: React Native (for cross-platform compatibility).
UI/UX: Tailwind CSS.
2) Chatbot & Web Dashboard:
Framework: React.js (frontend), Node.js (backend integration).
Multilingual Support: Google Translate API / IndicNLP libraries for Indian languages.
3) Back-End & APIs :
Programming Languages: Python , Node.js.
Frameworks: Django.
4) Databases:
SQL.
MongoDB.
Cloud Services: AWS / Google Cloud / Microsoft Azure.

Implementation Workflow :
Data Pipeline (Python): Collect soil/weather/market data → preprocess → store in SQL.
ML Training (Python): Train models for fertilizer recommendation, pest detection, yield prediction.
API Layer (Node.js, Django): Expose advisory outputs to mobile/web apps.
Mobile App (Kotlin/React Native): Farmer interacts via chatbot/voice → queries sent to API → ML output delivered in local language.
Voice Services (Python + Google Speech API): Convert farmer voice queries into text → process → return advisory as audio.

## Feasibility and Viability

This solution is practical and possible because most farmers today have access to smartphones and affordable internet. Cloud services and open-source AI tools make it cheaper and easier to build and expand across different regions.The idea is also useful and valuable for farmers. By giving timely advice on crops, soil, weather, and markets, it can help farmers increase their yield , reduce costs, and improve their income.The app is designed to be multilingual and voice-based, so even farmers with low literacy can use it. Since it can adapt to different crops, regions, and climates, it is suitable for large-scale use. It supports farmer income, food security, and sustainable agriculture.

## Impact and Benefits

The solution will help small and marginal farmers make better decisions on crops, fertilizers, and pest control, leading to higher yields, lower costs, and stable incomes.It empowers farmers socially through real-time, local-language guidance, supports economic growth by reducing wastage and improving market access, and protects the environment by promoting soil health and reducing chemical overuse.It builds a knowledge-driven farming ecosystem that benefits farmers and the overall agri-sector.
